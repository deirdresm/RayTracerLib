# RayTracerLib
Swift Package for Ray Tracer (refactor from old RayTracer repo)

## Current State

* Code and tests complete through Chapter 9 (Planes). Have not yet written the code for the example at the end of the chapter. (Also haven't brought over older example code from the old project for creating test images.)

* Most files of ray traced objects ported over, but not yet converted to newer model I intend to use.

* Intend to write a JSON-based model of shapes that can be rendered into a PPM, but haven't thought deeply about the format yet.
